# starter_folder

This repository contains all data needed for my paper: Number of Toronto Crime Cases Is Changing From Rising To Declining.

It is organised as follow: the inputs folder contains crime data imported from 
the City of Toronto Open Data Portal and literature that I referred to. 
The scripts section contains a script of how I downloaded the crime data. 
The outputs section contains my paper as pdf and Rmd files, and my references list.
